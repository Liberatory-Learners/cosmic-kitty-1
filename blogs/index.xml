      <description>April 19, 2021 The ridge between my fingers are cracking through to the bullshit. I forgot, for awhile why I am here on this planet. Sorry. I’m back now. Here, I’m energizing myself – listening to the peace dealer, Phil good life, Lori, and quantumkassy with big empress adding the glitter and rainbow light around to shine through the body snatch-rs who are determined to steal my/your/our consciousness – burn personalities, identities that we’ve assumed and roles that we’ve fulfilled and contents that were presently here – April – to accelerate my ascension path – giving us a chance to anchor in the multi dimensional human – – so much bigger than who we thought we were – we think there is something wrong – we splinter off continually – 1 – no longer trying to escape certain situations – who I know myself to be – toggling between -unconscious file that has been with me – if there is any discord that is being felt in my being – it is a file that has been with you – disharmony has been with me all along – relative – imitation that was self imposed that has been with me all along that has been carried over – bad blood – used to operate linearly – the now is synonymous with the quantum field – materialize from the quantum field – ( I don’t even remember where I heard this from) so, now that we’re here.</description>

      <description>March 20, 2021 “The feminine is more powerful than the masculine, the soft is more powerful than the hard, the water is more powerful than the rock.” – Osho It’s been a week since the last post – 12 minutes past due – an orphaned moment – Bitcoin is surging. The stimulus checks are filtering in. Many people are collecting unemployment. At some point Nike becomes a commodity and Prada loses interest in itself, everyone has enough to pay for the class they need to improve their BMI and money is exposed as rechargeable digits.</description>

      <description>March 13, 2021 The Master Imbues His Speciality Whatever knowledge the Master is known to have, with it the souls of his pupils are imbued: The theologian imbues with theology; the master of law with jurisprudence. The master who is absorbed in the Way will help the seeker become absorbed in God. Of all the things to know, the best preparation and provision on the day of death is the knowledge of spiritual poverty.</description>

      <description>March 11, 2021 You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” ― Buckminster Fuller A continuation from a few days ago – When I say “don’t white man this” – I mean don’t find a way to capitalize on something pure. This means, stop trying to sell something, an idea, a product, a methodology with the “should” narrative, through the “this is how business is done” tone, or the “if you want x then you must do y” mindset.</description>

      <description>February 9, 2021 That how something looks is better than what something is – That nothing you ever do is good enough – for others – Tat mistakes were atrocities to be feared – shamed – ridiculed. Instead of embraced – with dignity and honor for oneself in their decision to keep pushing forward no matter how badly it felt – or how badly it hurt – that you were going to succeed no matter what – as long as you smiled and kept going – That agenda has no bunds – That I am, and we are fucking funny – If only they didn’t tax our joy – Or tried to humble us with shame Guilt forced sorries mitigated loser download false contraptions mistaken as contributions secrets what nation doesn’t have any?</description>

      <description>February 7, 2021 We must run the risk of companies threatening to sue us for harassment. But I don’t think that will happen because we are simply calling in as customer feedback. Initial hurdles might include creating the momentum for the number of calls and the time that it will take to secure a physical facility and crowd funding to buy the machines. Unless there are leaders in other parts of the world who want to start their own country’s call to action, time zone synchronization might be difficult.</description>

      <description>February 7, 2021 Our idea will be scaled through a high impact social media outreach plan. With the prize money, we will build a Squarespace website, hire a social media marketer who will be able to make beautiful Canva, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook social media content while managing our SEO presence online for a few months as an open contractor. This will be someone who cares and understands the mission to be able to create content that will travel on various local TV Network and radio stations in and around New York City.</description>

      <description>February 7, 2021 Collective action as a by-product of collective consciousness permeates boundaries beyond our imagination. Consistent effort creates compound interest. Showing up on the days to call the companies creates both an internal and external push that will create a dent in the system. When Nestle gets 20 calls and then 200 calls and then 2000 calls a month asking them to change their packaging, Nestle not only has the data necessary for the people who are in charge of changing the packaging, they have direct input from their customers asking them for a change.</description>

      <description>February 6, 2021 The idea will be developed by word of mouth, social media shares, collaborative involvement across the world and linking multiple communities together that will grow and develop organically. We have created a LinkTree for the current components that we are building to gather a larger following by producing different types of content (the plastic hour, plastic play Wednesday where we work with plastic artist from Hawaii every other Wednesday on creating plastic art, and a women and children’s shelter that we’re building in Nigeria as well as a podcast called Love, Go Do It.</description>

      <title>The Festival of Urgent Reinventions: Who is your idea intended for? What community will be most impacted by it? </title>

      <description>February 6, 2021 The idea is intended for the stakeholders, CEOs, gatekeepers, sales representatives, and ultimately who decides on the packaging for supermarket items and the 10 companies that control most of the food industry. 
This is also intended to create a community around like minded folk who care about eliminating plastic waste from the food industry. By meeting twice a week for our “plastic hour” and probably more frequently as the group grows, there will be more calls and more data collected by the companies that will reflect a consumer request to change their packaging.</description>

Here is our plan and strategy for the brief to Reduce Plastic on our Collective Earth. Titties for change is an art collective based in New York City. We have been hosting anti-war anti plastic vegan parties for over 2 years and have more than 12 regular members who participate in our open mics, vegan pot lucks, and strategy sessions. We plan on partnering with Noply and precious plastics to create an online PLASTIC HOUR community that aims to provide customer feedback for plastic manufacturing companies urging them to switch their product to OOHO material.</description>

“Who’s Brad Pitt?”, E, an 11 year old who I teach on Thursdays asks me when I say that famous people are boring and if I had a choice between meeting brad Pitt and libby, his mom’s friend’s cousin? who had a rainbow unicorn themed wedding, I would pick libby. I told him that it was comforting to know that he didn’t know who brad Pitt was. That there was hope in the world.</description>

Happy Day. I have transcribed some of the things that Jim speaks about below. https://open.spotify.com/episode/2PU4294U9pfERzNgqBdCjF?si=gTYGbB4vR9ag_JaOBnkBMw SIX Things to Stop Doing in 2021.
Stop Caring What Other People Think – I feel like I’ve never really been the type of person to care so much about what others thought of me until I started losing friendships – for many reasons – people change and sometimes the cogs don’t fit anymore – it doesn’t mean that I won’t let them back into my life or that I am actively ignoring them but I found myself caring or maybe it’s more like thinking about them while I am pursing the thing that I never allowed myself to do while we were friends, when I am putting myself out there in a way that is not tied to their approval, or maybe it’s me doing my own thing without their support that makes me wonder what they would think about what I was/am doing – weird – because the fact that we’re not speaking is an indicator that they and myself have outgrown whatever version of ourselves and the way of life that we agreed to.</description>

      <description>February 1, 2021 Day 3 of Kwik Learning: Find your Dominant Question
He mentions this book –
The Structor of Scientific Revolution by Thomas S. Kuhn.
According to Kuhn, ” a careful study of the history of science reveals that development in any scientific field happens via a series of phases” which makes me think about how we might be able to borrow the developmental phrases of science to think about the evolutionary process of curing the world from plastic, and all the other dancing components that are latched onto its continued existence.</description>

I did a technology cleanse from Saturday 7pm to Sunday 7pm this weekend. It was both intoxicating and necessary. Anxiety crept in at around 5pm on Sunday when I knew that I had to turn my phone on. to sit in on a Clubhouse meeting at 7pm. (The only reason why I would even, okay not true – I also needed to blog and hadn’t scheduled a post for today) Turned out the meeting was about African spirituality and not about raising funds for Africa which I thought it was for – no big deal – I ended up getting three more bookings for the Love, Do It Podcast from three amazing women who I cannot wait to speak with during the following weeks.</description>

      <description>January 30, 2021 In the culture of Hannah Yukon – no one gets left out of the sharing circle. However, tonight feels like there might be a slight distinction between what needs to get said and what actually gets said. Grind culture, anti-blackness, and the politics of naps – a few breaths of joy, remembrance, tears and magic, Nina Foster is a wave of freshness, a hover over a Moon lit lake, and a deep dive into the unknown.</description>

      <description>January 28, 2021 Listening to Evan on Soundcloud and googling higher frequency arppegios and pedal steel sounds. Music makes me a better person. I want to be the correct version of myself at all times. Somewhere along the way I let the poison in for too long and then became addicted to pain. Tension lives now in my legs when I go more than 24 hours without stretching my body. It makes me bite my nails.</description>

      <description>January 27, 2021 “What Sustains You?” This was a writing prompt from a Freaks Books Club that I was in with artists Rene and Manny Rivera. April 4, 2019. “The sun in her glory of self and the knowledge that doesn’t hurt the knowing that family runs deep and the state of being alone is contingent upon doubt that you are enough. Knowing that the food comes from the ground where the ground is above, that things are changing and that I am holding myself accountable to what matters to me and what keeps me happy, an ultimatum that bares no consequence and perhaps even when the coughing hurts knowing that I have breathe to dig into the capillaries is also what sustains me – the relationships, there is a word to describe the labor and value associated albeit arbitrary and fictitious equations to the living – a type of performance that requires presence and attention to detail, sharp and slightly sinister – the ability to wake and behave according to my own rules the mountains in the sky their shapes reminding me to continue.</description>

Sept 29, 2020 Where am I really from? Micah’s belly. What if everyone’s experience of reality is a religion? The moment of being in awe of another for extended periods of time leads to idolization – in the act of that, we forget ourselves and our godliness. This is why everyone has their own code where their religion becomes what one folds one’s life around.</description>

      <description>January 12, 2021 Plastic is an organism. It carries a particular energetic materiality. It holds history and transportation routes; knowledge in its very essence. Plastic was once a good thing. It was loved and adored by all. The creators of it were deemed heroes and geniuses. everyone was happy. But then something happened. To pin point exactly would be to lose sight of the whole picture – by zooming in, the rest gets observed in our hidden knowing – object permanence – we know the rest of the map exists but we can’t see it.</description>

The Now – aspect – the silent auras circulate – two honks and a dirty engine – it takes a calm refusal to smooth out the roughness – a fluid sway in the body – mechanical rumblings of the M train – a flash back memory to that movie Michelle recommended – Snowpiercier – around and around in ice and snow until until until – go watch the movie – Cockroaches – last night I flushed one into the toilet bowl.</description>

Clubhouse is my new favorite thing. I have Randy to thank for telling me about it, and Sabio for the invite.</description>

      <description>January 7, 2021 Boards with neon colors grabbing our attention, mine, maybe yours, with their symmetrical configurations, like Monday, the organizational tool. There are recognizable tendencies and patterns within the spheres of digital marketing and advertising, where one learns codified manipulation tactics to induce desire. Sacred geometry implored for diapers, a work out mirror, $3000 bedsheets. I forget where the phrase “aesthetics will kill you” comes from. The fight is on to see how far I will use these skills to make things better for the rest of the world starting with the women and young girls.</description>

Today felt like a dream. I went to bed at 430am on Sunday and woke up at 7am to read for a bit, Micah woke me up and I couldn’t go back to sleep again. I must have fallen back asleep at 830am and when I woke up it was 1pm. I haven’t slept like that in a really long time. There were dreams about old friends, making up, forgiveness and some type of traveling expedition where I was a host consoling one of my old friends in Singapore.</description>

It’s the first Monday of the year 2021. The Moon is waning gibbous in Virgo. I already lost my no sugar goal by consuming three fried Oreos from Tony’s after confronting a thought I had earlier this morning that I was going to die within the next two years. I am only mildly concerned about this download because so far, my predictions about certain things have been accurate.</description>

my attention. Creating cycles around an already circular platform of thought. Guitar picking. Somber wanting. Touching sensitively the grass looking forward to lunch. Started the yin yoga week with Kasandra – Tuesday is orange – sacral, made orange French toast – bread from the Mexican bakery down the road, the owner let me off with $1.50 debt – they picked two cards – realizing how with the current situation in the world, people are choosing to go inward to answer the questions they pick for themselves.</description>

Titties For Change is a Research Hub Dedicated to Ending Plastic Production Forever Through the Study of Utopian Ideas, Independent Thought, and the Imagination.

We are anti-war, anti-plastic, vegan art collective that creates hybrid spaces to educate, re-create, entertain, heal, and transform to find long term solutions to plastic production, homelessness, poverty, slavery and war by shifting rhetoric from “impossible” to “possible” by changing the world through expression, creative projects, and community outreach.</description>
