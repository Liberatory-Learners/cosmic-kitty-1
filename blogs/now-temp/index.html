What Does It Mean To Be A Friend, Now*?
The Now – aspect – the silent auras circulate – two honks and a dirty engine – it takes a calm refusal to smooth out the roughness – a fluid sway in the body – mechanical rumblings of the M train – a flash back memory to that movie Michelle recommended – Snowpiercier – around and around in ice and snow until until until – go watch the movie –
Cockroaches – last night I flushed one into the toilet bowl.
I am getting a cockroach tattoo. The thought in the mirror as I try to squeeze a zit on my chin says that people will think you carry similar characteristics as the cockroach – The other half said “ would you rather be beautiful or have the chance to carry billions of years of information and understand the world through a different modality?”
I could also be a butterfly. Because they are pretty. – Not pretty –
Colorful. The close up of a butterfly – <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2680542/The-aliens-garden-Stunning-close-photography-reveals-vibrant-colours-exotic-beauty-butterflies.html">research </a>found –
Remembrance.
UBER takes 33.3% from the drivers. Each ride. Every driver.
The American cockroach lays its eggs in an egg capsule which is called an “ootheca”. American cockroaches contaminate food with their feces and defensive secretions, and carry pathogenic organisms on the feet and legs. They can also carry intestinal diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. People who experience frequent and prolonged exposure to cockroaches may develop mild to severe allergic reactions, such as dermatitis, itching, swelling of the eyelids, and serious respiratory conditions.
Parasite – another great movie. Also a recommendation from Michelle.
Drivers get charged 33.3 % per ride so that the employees at UBER get company lunches – cooked by people who make minimum wage so that UBER employees can have their lunches catered and delivered. Running around saying words like “analytics”  and “SEO” in a sentence without making eye contact with the person who just cycled in the snow with oven-mitts tapped to their wrists, plastic bags covering the oven-mitts to keep the warm in, so that you can have Pad Thai at 11pm.
Gentle awareness.
There is much pulling at my attention. It feels scattered. Fragments and spiraling. On the good days I am able to leave the house and dance outside. On the bad days I bite my fingernails and nap. I have been procrastinating. Today I found an orange magnetic whiteboard. The moon is think and reddish orange tonight. She takes my breath away. How she hangs out in the sky. This afternoon I cut more of my hair off. It looks a lot better. It feels better too. I don’t feel like I will ever need to go see a hair stylist again to cut my hair now that I figured out this hack.
I must listen to the <a href="https://genekeys.com/articles/the-55-2/">55th</a> gene key tonight.

How to Work on Foot Reflexology Pressure Points – Techniques
In traditional Western Reflexology, points and areas can be worked using thumb-walking, finger-walking, pivoting, and sliding. (1) Eastern Reflexology and some Integrative Reflexology practices may also include the use of light stroking, knuckles, circular friction, and tools.
Thumb-walking – Can be used on the majority of the reflexes, with the exception of very small points. The outer edge of the tip of the thumb applies the pressure. With the first knuckle of the thumb bent, move the thumb all around reflex being worked by taking tiny “steps” with the thumb.
Finger-walking – Is done using a finger or multiple fingers rather than the thumb, but with the same kind of process as thumb-walking. It is used primarily on the top and sides of the feet.
Pivoting – Is used on small reflex points to pinpoint pressure. The tip of the thumb is rotated slowly on the reflex point.
Sliding – Can be used to help break down deposits, and is performed by sliding the thumb over an area while maintaining gentle pressure.
Light strokes – Are used on the tops of the feet and over the ankles.
Circular friction -Can be used in a manner similar to thumb-walking on many reflex areas. Is often used in Eastern Reflexology on the lines on the inside and outside of the lower legs. The fingers or thumb is moved in a circular manner along a reflex line.
Knuckles – Can be used to put deeper pressure on areas on the bottom of the foot, or used in a similar manner to pivoting with the thumb.
Tools – Such as reflexology sticks are used to reduce the strain on the hands of the practitioner. They can be used like pivoting on specific reflexology points or can be used for light stroking or sliding. Care must be taken when using a tool to not exert excessive pressure.</p>

Listen and meditate to this once you’ve done the exercise above with
sacredsisterscircle.
Today was intense. We went to 77 Mulberry Street in Chinatown and got dim sum at <a href="https://www.bodaivegetarian.com/">Bodhi Vegetarian Restaurant</a> for dinner and got a bunch of Asian snacks and bubble tea. Sometimes I can eat and eat until I am in pain. I told the waiter that I was eating for my ancestors. I don’t know which is the right incense to burn. I wish I could call them and ask. Unsure if I should be burning Chinese incense on the same alter that I am honoring my Jewish ancestors. Would my Chinese ancestors enjoy Challah bread? I need to clean the alter tomorrow and get myself in the gym after all those carbs. I can be so stubborn with my well-being. I know that not going to the gym for more than 2 days in a row puts me in a depressive state that makes me unwilling to cook (so I order out) which is not good because I need to be practicing every day – same thing with shuffling, music, yoga and transcription. These are my daily tasks that I have given myself. Since discovering the joy of Google Calendar, my hours are color coded and demarcated so I am always with the next activity to do. Keeping to this schedule will help me get what I need to get done. While I miss going out and eating inside, I really do appreciate this time where we’re able to stay inside and work on what we need to work on. I wish I didn’t lend Yusuf my loop pedal. This is where I trip up over not listening to my intuition and wanting to believe in the higher versions of my friends. Sometimes I wish it was night time and quiet for a lot longer. Apparently the Earth is speeding up, which might explain the shorter days.
I found that when someone says “um” they are being stopped by someone else’s negative thought about them. The trick is to get ourselves into an arena of complete support and love. I feel closer every day with the map. I will be sharing this soon. Something big is about to happen. I wish my friends and family would stop eating meat and drinking alcohol so that we can hang out again. I wish they understood how much of that energy affects how they interact with me, how sensitive I have become now that I am a year without that inside of my body. I am going to re-start Mandy Morris’s manifest authenticity program tomorrow and make sure that I get enough sleep this week so that I remember to be myself and nothing else. When someone coughs, it means that energy doesn’t belong inside of them. My roommate coughs as soon as I write this. Invasive thoughts comes from a source of magic. I wrote malice but it auto-corrected it to magic – perhaps truth – when the sniffles come that is the demonic energy leaving the body. When we yawn we are self protecting from someone else’s negative opinion about us. I just yawned. We know when we sneeze someone is thinking about us hard. I haven’t figured out where our hiccups come from.
There is so much to do everyday. I need to be near the ocean or walking on dirt in a forest. This is going to be my last winter in New York City. I should enjoy it a lot more. I need to make sure I meditate twice tomorrow. I wish that more students would enroll in the <a href="https://www.liberatorylearners.com/">Minecraft classes</a> so that I can get headshots and Logic Pro. I worked on the website tonight and I am proud of it although I can’t seem to get the lines to align but that might need to wait until later on this week. I am looking forward to designing a tree house according the Architecture in <a href="https://www.azulik.com/">AZULIK</a> – Please someone send me there for my 30th birthday.
I just got invited to a random conversation on Clubhouse that was not pleasant. Time to sleep.
