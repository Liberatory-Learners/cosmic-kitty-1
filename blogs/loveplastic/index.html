Plastic is an organism. It carries a particular energetic materiality. It holds history and transportation routes; knowledge in its very essence. Plastic was once a good thing. It was loved and adored by all. The creators of it were deemed heroes and geniuses. everyone was happy.
But then something happened. To pin point exactly would be to lose sight of the whole picture – by zooming in, the rest gets observed in our hidden knowing – object permanence – we know the rest of the map exists but we can’t see it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g&amp;t=2s">Watch this video to understand more</a>.
How we get free healthcare is we make sure our therapists and doctors have a plumber they can go to, a dentist, a massage therapist, a chiropractor, essentially creating sub groups for each block – New York City – allow people to see a doctor that is down the street instead of an hour away because of “insurance” – <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/insurance/Historical-development-of-insurance">Who came up with insurance?</a>
<a href="https://time.com/4837864/healthcare-history-beginning-obamacare-ahca/">This article</a> from TIME magazine breaks it down.
“So, as more people wanted to go to more expensive doctors, they began to get creative. In the years before health insurance was the norm, Americans came up with all kinds of ways to pay for care. Free care at places like charity clinics and dispensaries was sometimes available, and barter was not uncommon. (“The image of the doctor accepting eggs or a pair of boots — that’s very true,” says Chapin.) And doctors often practiced a kind of sliding-scale fee system, in which they treated the poor for very little but expected their wealthier patients to pay more, subsidizing care for the community.”
“Meanwhile, medical authorities like the AMA watched these changes with trepidation. In their view, all of these options — union, physician groups, insurance — were a bad idea. “At that time, the AMA was against health insurance in general,” Chapin explains. “They didn’t want any other agent involved in the physician-patient relationship because they were worried that financier would become more and more powerful and end up reducing the physician’s sovereignty.”
In other news…
<a href="https://www.tetrapak.com/about/newsarchive/tetra-pak-commits-to-net-zero-emissions">Tetrapak</a>  announces commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its own operations by 2030, with the ambition to achieve net zero GHG emissions for the entire value chain by 2050 – this is going to be too late. They must understand this now.
“Time is a movement which man has divided into past, present, and future, and as long as he divides the will always be in conflict. We do not see the danger of many of our problems and therefore we invent time as a means of overcoming them.” J. Krishnamurti</p>
<p>September 13, 2020
The man across pressed out the bits of dirt from his blanket, the ends falling on the floor, the ground, wiping the dirt on his pants, I can’t look – its not a blanket, its a sweater – who was taking care of this man with the black thank you for shopping here plastic bag –
Mantis, shedding layers, the catastrophe of our inaction – the excluding of the self in relation to the other, the cleaning, the sides of who we could all be – the drums come on the train and everyone stops to pay attention – I hear the beat, like a rhythmic cacaadence – a lingering substance, I want to get up and dance, the cocoon of life, the meandering enfolding of what it means to be here, expressing joy in the Burts, the stops, the imagination in the precipice – the enslavement, entitlement, conundrum, everywhere all the time, the unfolding, unpack the bags of history, set it inside, outside – do it for the money, but for the call to action, what is it you believe in? What does it want to show you? How have you been – a father falls down from nowhere – the man across me still plucks on the bits of dirt, making pussing hand movements as he hits the tangents, brown stains on the other side of his shoes, the markings of wealth and life, the separation is becoming transparent, so much closer together we undress each other, he cares, not at all, he moves up his body, exposing his beige belly, his navel, a reminder that we’re connected through our collective birthing like a scratch you can’t itch.
Instead of saying oh my god my child will never see a seal, its like oh my god my child will never see a plastic lid again — the connection women have with each other are deeper than the wounds that separate.</p>
<p>Notes from a college class in 2015.
American occupation in Japan
Was Eseinhower against the war?
Military Industrial Complex
Congressional districts
When war becomes profitable, are we making valid decisions about our foreign policy?
Glorification of the Military
The poor who enlist in the military
As a “career thing” – an appeal to someone’s self interest and put them in a system that is based on self sacrifice.
News flashes of report and then news flashes of valor swift music video
Pursuing an imperial agenda
The American Empire
The Roman Republic
1961 – danger of unauthorized industrial complex
Why did we invade Iraq?
Too many people are not standing up fighting and saying that im. Not doing this anymore.
What is the media doing after 9/11?
Propaganda is universal
Security conditions made it impossible for free media to report
This is going back many years through a dynasty of imperial colonialists who wanted power and influence.
Sometimes we have to help our family make the connection because they might not be able to themselves</p>
<p>Aphorisms
We could fill an island with all the beards in the world and call it bearded island
Documentation is only as factual as the events in the documentaries mind.
Good company is only worth having in the most uncomfortable situations.
I’m sure if talking in public was more acceptable more people would do it.
A global tragedy needs to happen on Christmas to make the festival more conflicted.
If we heard static all day we would appreciate the sounds of the world a lot more.
Some stains can’t be removed for a reason.
People are most interesting when they are not being watched.
With some people you can tell what they were like as a child and what happened along the way.
Sometimes being late is a good thing.
Mothers react to the world. Fathers observe and wait to be told.
“Kia Su” applies to all people. It’s just more culturally celebrated in other countries.</p>

We don’t need the war
Children’s clothes that do not use slave labor
The G.I Bill was not a good thing for veterans</p>
<p>Sitting a Intrepid museum out with the Girl Scouts giving plastic toys in green paper bags – the security guard can’t tell me where I need to be – my defiant nature oozes out my eyes balls when I feel like an eggplant that forgot to get salted. I have a cardboard box in between my legs and WW2 playing behind me . In response to James Duffy imprisonment I say you were not supposed to even be there, fool.
If life was improv, saying yes becomes a habitual agreement with it all, and humor becomes a weapon against the pain.
What about a light saber? Who gets to know what a light saber is?
Who gets to own one as a toy?
The brand becomes part of the scheme – to untangle is to detach completely – it demands of you something that you are unable o refuse – a way of existence – capitalism is wrapped up in our private lives – our inner most scared section of the vessel – I must keep that part of myself pure and keep those chakras aligned every day and not skip out on our ritual and complete the tasks every day doing a little bit at a time not forcing or pushing or blaming or jilting or shaming or controlling into a yield –  flowing with that inner self and learning how to not let myself get hooked onto narratives that – do not ultimately serve me in the most present of states – i feel the shadows lingering around and I must move my body – to release the chills that now run through my body – There is 15 more minutes to the bagel pudding – I am excited to eat this and go to sleep.
Fortune and luxurious are those who get to go to brunch.
