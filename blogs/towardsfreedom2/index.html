“The feminine is more powerful than the masculine, the soft is more powerful than the hard, the water is more powerful than the rock.” – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Joy-Living-Dangerously-Osho/dp/0312205171/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Osho&amp;qid=1616223062&amp;sr=8-3">Osho</a>
It’s been a week since the last post – 12 minutes past due – an orphaned moment –
Bitcoin is surging. The stimulus checks are filtering in. Many people are collecting unemployment. At some point Nike becomes a commodity and Prada loses interest in itself, everyone has enough to pay for the class they need to improve their BMI and money is exposed as rechargeable digits. Banks shut down. Wall Street becomes an outdoor coffeeshop serving free food and the student to teacher ratio is 5:1.
ROI stands for <a href="https://letstalkvegan.today/recipe/caribbean-curried-butternut-squash-roti">Roti Opportunity Index</a> – meaning, how much of your labor will guarantee that you get a roti for the day – or at all – certainly not everyone will feel enthusiastic about roti, at least without having had one before – life changes after one has had roti. Priorities shift. Chekov wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagull-Hampton-version-Christopher-Chekhov/dp/0822223457/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1CL8DUV62KISL&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+seagull+chekhov&amp;qid=1616223170&amp;sprefix=the+seagull%2Caps%2C169&amp;sr=8-4">plays</a> after he did his doctor things for the day. I can be a musician who sells houses. Anything is possible. Nails grow back.
I was starring at the screen wondering where I should even begin with this week. After showing more than 18 clients over the last 2 weeks, I have no deals closed. This is scary because the month is almost up and if I do not close at least one more deal I owe the brokerage $400 for failing to meet my quota. I went on a juice cleanse for 2.5 days before caving and eating pizza. Since then I have eaten a plethora of exquisite peanut butter banana sandwiches and burritos, tom yam soup, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=mediterranean&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi59vrDhL7vAhVjU98KHWsZD7wQkeECKAB6BAgLEC8">mediterranean platter</a> and 5 doughnut holes. We picked up a new couch from Craigslist and I was left was $0.22 in my bank account for 3 days. Living on the edge. To face the current reality with deadpan is to deny the excitement that churns the undertow. The future is NFTs, Bitcoin (wtf is bitcoin still?), organic agriculture, a furthering of dimensions between spiritual beings who believe that the sun will be the only energy source that we will need in the future to fuel our bodies and those still entrenched in the rational, linear, patriarchal framework that keeps the majority of the world trapped within the confines of tax brackets, military enrollment and public school lunches.
Right now I am a spy in that latter world gathering information and resources to bring into the former. only a real spy will know the difference between my role as trickster, artist, entrepreneur and FBI agent and the distractions I throw to confuse you for the sake of experience.
Back to starring at the screen not knowing where to take this post. All of a sudden the iTunes segment for “stand up for who the fuck is cho chang?” comes pops up on the top right hand corner of my screen. It’s the first voice memo from a one woman show that I created back in 2018 that ended up being the reason why I moved back to New York, getting a performance fellowship with the Brooklyn Arts Exchange, meeting Morena, getting invited to perform at the Langston Hughes House in Harlem, meeting a bunch of organizers who later became partners with TFC and has been a major factor to our growth and metamorphosis.
A section in the voice memo:
“This is all part of some movement choreography that will come with some kind of dance. Had this fucking emotional moment tonight dancing in my backyard – it was the new moon and I was like re-born I was like fuck, this is rebirth, this is rebirth, this is fucking real – you don’t just change over night they say, but like what if you did? As an experience you could tap into new energy that makes you fearless and if you are fearless the world becomes a playground – but the thing is, people are going to let themselves play, Tei Shi, choreographing a segment Rebirth this is rebirth this is fucking real – they say you don’t change overnight but what if you did? To tap into a new energy that makes you fearless. If you are become fearless, the world becomes a playground…people will let themselves play until they let themselves bleed – too bad for guys, for us it’s just like, oh we’re bleeding right now? whatever lets go for brunch. We – every month – have the ability – women – we have the ability to be renewed! This is who this is for! Women! Come together please. Please come together. Then explore care in terms of community, in terms of who we are with each other. Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Constantly new, difference, don’t put me in a fucking box, worst off, don’t put yourself in a fucking box. Cos I was like so what if I am this race? so what if I am this gender? So what if im into dudes and girls and you know, Burger King. So what? and its like oh shit, it’s myself! And then what I started to think about was features. Taking into account how someone looks takes into account all the ism-isms that we’re talking about in politics – even though I stay very out of politics – I can’t – yeah – read more to know more but also to form your own opinions about this – like I don’t have an opinion about trump – is it okay for me not to have an opinion? that’s attacking something different. who cares in the end? who really cares? all these conversations take up so much space in this beautiful world – love child is a band in Brooklyn that I went to one time with my friend Sophie – she does designing things and is amazing – Sophie is a girl I met through a woman whose friend introduced me to – the friend – I met at my ex-boyfriends uncle’s friend’s networking event in Singapore…”
The voice memo continues for another 16 minutes but I need to go to bed soon – I teach tomorrow and have a shoot for an organic mushroom commercial for day time Korean television. I also need to get myself to the gym tomorrow it’s been almost 2 weeks since I’ve worked out and I feel my muscles disappearing under my skin.
Skin is funny – today I saw across from a Black man while reading this passage from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Undrowned-Feminist-Lessons-Emergent-Strategy/dp/1849353972/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Undrowned&amp;qid=1616222436&amp;sr=8-1">Undrowned</a></p>
<p>Needed to include the picture where <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexispauline/">APG</a> re-shared my picture (insert heart eyes)
The future is Black and Asian and Brown and Female and Femme and Colorful and Fluffy and Edible Glitter will be the new stock market and that is all I will say about this for now. I am going to cut cords following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIITkL2MG1M">Oliver and Mandy’s instructions</a>, integrate what I learned from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/philgoodlife/">Phil</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quantumkassy/">Kassy</a>, remember to write down my dreams tomorrow, yoga, learn how to make a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QSVqBLQ-bk">different red stone piston doors</a> and check in with some clients.
how does this view help integrate capitalism for our future? that depends on you and your willingness to meditate everyday – once the inside is sorted, the outside will be as well. This takes the load off a lot of tension within myself, just saying this – capitalism will be integrated once masculinity as a form starts to stop being so afraid of its divine counterpart and learns how to stretch, dress better, eat with more color and fewer dead animals, dance, play and respect the moon cycles.
Speaking of moon cycles – <a href="https://player.captivate.fm/episode/b48b0f34-f0ae-4f98-bc5c-d556ad221e94/">here</a> is the latest titties for change podcast with Chaya – or you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w61Zi0sAMGs&amp;t=2226s">play it on Youtube</a> –
Slowly, everyday, a little at a time.
