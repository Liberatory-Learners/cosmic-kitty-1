<a href="https://www.kwiklearningonline.com/">Day 3 of Kwik Learning</a>: Find your Dominant Question</p>
<p>He mentions this book –</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions">The Structor of Scientific Revolution by Thomas S. Kuhn</a>.</p>
<p>According to Kuhn, ” a careful study of the history of science reveals that development in any scientific field happens via a series of phases” which makes me think about how we might be able to borrow the developmental phrases of science to think about the evolutionary process of curing the world from plastic, and all the other dancing components that are latched onto its continued existence.</p>
<p>“The first he christened “normal science” – business as usual, if you like. In this phase, a community of researchers who share a common intellectual framework – called a paradigm or a “disciplinary matrix” – engage in solving puzzles thrown up by discrepancies (anomalies) between what the paradigm predicts and what is revealed by observation or experiment. Most of the time, the anomalies are resolved either by incremental changes to the paradigm or by uncovering observational or experimental error. As philosopher Ian Hacking puts it in his terrific preface to the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0226458121/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0226458121&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meme11-21">new edition</a> of Structure: “Normal science does not aim at novelty but at clearing up the status quo. It tends to discover what it expects to discover.”</p>
<p>The parallel: I see as us overcoming plastic pollution, the initial paradigm, from conversations that I have had with retail store managers, sales representatives from companies who refuse to change their packaging, and leaders who are fighting the climate crisis themselves who do not believe that we can move away entirely from plastic, is a reflection of their consciousness and where they are metaphorically standing that has either enabled them or disempowered them from forming a conclusion that really targets the root of the problem – if someone is diabetic, no matter how many times they go for dialysis, if they keep eating sugar, the diabetes is going to get worse, (depending on what type of diabetes one has) – similarly, because plastic is such a huge contaminant in our world, doesn’t it make sense to shift the conversation away from “recycling” to “removing completely from our in-progress circular economy?”</p>
<p>I’m hesitant to leave this problem in the hands of our leaders because they seem to think that we have time – to wait until 2030 or worse, 2050, to solve this – by making promises to reduce carbon emissions, or <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/">“ensure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050.”</a></p>
<p>It all sounds fluffy. The language used to describe what Biden will do compared to what trump had done feels like we’re still in the preliminary stages of the presidential elections. Why are you still talking about Trump? Sometimes I feel like there is a deep addiction to mockery, suffering and romanticized loneliness that pushes discourse into familiar tunnels so that communities can stay grid locked to what is comforting. “Let’s all get together and continue to trash talk someone who isn’t even playing the game anymore instead of moving our communities into spaces that find cures to the disease.”
“Born in 1922 in Cincinnati, he studied physics at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude in 1943, after which he was swept up by the war effort to work on radar. He returned to Harvard after the war to do a PhD – again in physics – which he obtained in 1949. He was then elected into the university’s elite Society of Fellows and might have continued to work on quantum physics until the end of his days had he not been commissioned to teach a course on science for humanities students as part of the General Education in Science curriculum. This was the brainchild of Harvard’s reforming president, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bryant_Conant">James Conant</a>, who believed that every educated person should know something about science.”
I believe that every educated person (and what does this even mean, really?) should know something about art –</p>
<p>“Where the standard account saw steady, cumulative “progress”, he saw discontinuities – a set of alternating “normal” and “revolutionary” phases in which communities of specialists in particular fields are plunged into periods of turmoil, uncertainty and angst. These revolutionary phases – for example the transition from Newtonian mechanics to quantum physics – correspond to great conceptual breakthroughs and lay the basis for a succeeding phase of business as usual. The fact that his version seems unremarkable now is, in a way, the greatest measure of his success. But in 1962 almost everything about it was controversial because of the challenge it posed to powerful, entrenched philosophical assumptions about how science did – and should – work.”
Sounds like what we’re going through right now.</p>
<p>“Kuhn’s blinding insight came from the sudden realisation that if one is to understand Aristotelian science, one must know about the intellectual tradition within which Aristotle worked. One must understand, for example, that for him the term “motion” meant change in general – not just the change in position of a physical body, which is how we think of it. Or, to put it in more general terms, to understand scientific development one must understand the intellectual frameworks within which scientists work. That insight is the engine that drives Kuhn’s great book.”</p>
<p>unrelated links – or maybe they might be relatable – today went by so quickly. I am working with Michelle, my childhood friend on re-designing this website. I am going to shower and get into bed before midnight so that I can wake up at 6am like I have been wanting to for the last month to get in all the work that I wanna do – time goes by slower in the mornings than they do in the afternoons.</p>
<p>I love being alive in the world. I will not let the bad things get me down. I choose boundaries that might feel like I am giving something up but ultimately need to be created for mental health reason. Found myself really missing my mom but knowing that I cannot make room for her in my life because I literally get so depressed after every time I talk to her.</p>
<p>Letting go of my own stubbornness when it comes to choosing one thing. So far it looks like</p>
<p>Music + Music Videos – which means growing and sharing my patron when it is ready and going Live on Facebook, IG, and Youtube when I make the monthly schedule for shows.
Titties for change – which means the blog, the Love, Go Do It Podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D2Rw5KZVuc">Plastic Play Wednesdays</a> and the monthly parties that we host.</p>
<p><a href="http://liberatorylearners.com/">Liberatory Learners</a> – which means I need to get started on the business class that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2BiYQn2OK597G8RbdIj8dw">Women Empower X</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Xmw8JwfXG-JfRbHxw1Nkg">Denzel Napoleon Rodriguez</a> gifted me so that I can start growing the number of students that I have which will allow me to fuel more studio time and more studio time means more music and videos which means more patron subscribers which means more resources to fuel titties for change and the more titties for change is fueled the more the anti-plastic movement will grow and that is really, along with the dancing particles, what this is all about.</p>
<p>Must do a video of what I mean when I reference all the dancing particles.
Here is a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAPQxxgBwgM">the first episode</a> of a conversation with writer, poet, artist, educator Nina Oteria on the second episode of Love, Go Do It.
