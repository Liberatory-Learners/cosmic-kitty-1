<p>Today I made:
Vegan Peanut Butter Orange Chocolate Banana Bread</p>
<p>Dry:
1 Cup (any type of Flour)
Cinnamon to taste
Cloves to taste
Orange peel to taste
Baking powder
Baking soda
Salt
Wet:
1 Cup Apple Sauce
1/4 Silk almond milk
1/4 Peanut Butter
1/4 Brown Caster Sugar
1/4 cup diced Endangered Species Chocolate, Oat Milk Rice Crisp + Dark Chocolate, 55% Cocoa
Mash 3 super ripe bananas together and add it to the wet ingredients.
Mix dry ingredients together
Mix wet ingredients together
Add wet to dry ingredients together. Bake in oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.
Stick a chopstick or knife in the center to make sure it is baked all the way through. You will know that it is done when the chopstick or knife is clean and doesn’t carry any sticky residue. If it needs to be left inside the oven but the top is getting burnt, cover the top with aluminum foil. That prevents burning.
Enjoy with Chai tea or a glass of almond milk and listen to milo’s almond milk paradise song.
We watched Greta last night. Take away: The youth of tomorrow are the leaders of today. As their elders, we protect, serve and restore. The rest is hullabaloo. I love that she laughed when the politicians called her names and when they discredited her work. There is much healing to do moving forward. Men need to heal in ways that require them to end the perpetuation of production for profit. They need time and space to learn to love themselves again. Patriarchy hurts men just as much as it hurts women and children, only in different ways, as power transpires through different wormholes of pain. The collective needs more time to mend the wounds that have been repeating for centuries. This is going to take all of our collective effort. Men are not the enemy. The system (our current system) that was created from a misconstrued religious perspective and old doctrines and narratives that were carried over from a Neolithic historical remembering where “men” were “providers” of material security, coupled with unconscious predicated pre-assigned performative aspects of masculinity that have been woven into our 3D reality where “money” – an archaic notion that assigns “value” to an illusion called “time” that is broken into fragments according to numerical representations of duration and longevity where the blind acceptance of these configurations have given birth to “labor” where “time equals x-value”. The system is arbitrary and a sham. I cannot wait for certain words to be erased from our vocabulary – words like “money” and “minimum wage” and “cost” – lack mentality arouses the worst in us when we know in the pit of our stomachs that there is more than enough for everyone. There is more than enough. For everyone. I cannot wait for Greta’s generation to change the current flow of power and attention. Watching the documentary made me realize how much work my generation has to do. Some of us have already been indoctrinated while the rest of us are in want of change but unsure of how to contribute our resources, or we fight with “best practices” and “prioritization of issues” when really it all ties into the same wheel of misfortune.
The first step towards the Global Reset is to stop eating meat and dairy. It is the first material thing you can do. This decision carries more weight in long term transformational longevity  than you will be able to immediately understand. This choice is kinda like making art. There is no method to measure your impact but there is a profound compounded interest in this one simple step (simple because it is) It is made complicated because you might make it about something else besides your individual free will and ability to choose) It makes such a difference. The act of the individual in practice is just as important as the act of the collective in union. Until you see and understand that for yourself, until you yourself are willing to make that sacrifice, there is little in your reality that will shift. You cannot be doing the same things that have gotten us to where we are and expect a different result. If you want to see a cultural shift in terms of how food, resources, time and labor are managed, you need to put your purchasing power into different pockets; pockets that belong to people and organizations that are against violence and war, pollution and mass production. You literally hold that much power every time you decide not to eat meat or dairy. I pause here for now.
It also depends on your belief system and levels of optimism in general. Try to go Vegan for a week and see how that makes you feel, or better yet, see how much of your perspective has changed on possibilities for the future. Capitalism is fueled on violence and suffering. There is enough for everybody. Capitalism doesn’t want you to know that. The people “in power” don’t want you to believe that because then you’ll find out the truth to their game and decide, like a lot of us on the other side, to stop playing. A game can’t run without the players. These politicians who care more about their pockets than the welfare of the people will die off. Their policies will go with them. They are already losing the war. Every time a vegan restaurant opens up, a slaughterhouse gets (this much) closer to being shut down. (This is important because of this article) The next step is to cancel rent so that businesses do not have to operate on plastic) see this video to hear a brief conversation between myself and Susan Champeny about the connection between rent and mortgage relief and ending plastic production. She taught us how to make flower petals from plastic bottles on Wednesday.
I am sad 2020 ended. While it was a painful year for many, it was a necessary wake up call. There will never be another year like it, probably just like how there will never be another day like the one we’re having right now.
