Happy Day. I have transcribed some of the things that Jim speaks about below. https://open.spotify.com/episode/2PU4294U9pfERzNgqBdCjF?si=gTYGbB4vR9ag_JaOBnkBMw SIX Things to Stop Doing in 2021.
Stop Caring What Other People Think – I feel like I’ve never really been the type of person to care so much about what others thought of me until I started losing friendships – for many reasons – people change and sometimes the cogs don’t fit anymore – it doesn’t mean that I won’t let them back into my life or that I am actively ignoring them but I found myself caring or maybe it’s more like thinking about them while I am pursing the thing that I never allowed myself to do while we were friends, when I am putting myself out there in a way that is not tied to their approval, or maybe it’s me doing my own thing without their support that makes me wonder what they would think about what I was/am doing – weird – because the fact that we’re not speaking is an indicator that they and myself have outgrown whatever version of ourselves and the way of life that we agreed to." />

<p>Happy Day. I have transcribed some of the things that Jim speaks about below.

SIX Things to Stop Doing in 2021.</p>
<p>Stop Caring What Other People Think – I feel like I’ve never really been the type of person to care so much about what others thought of me until I started losing friendships – for many reasons – people change and sometimes the cogs don’t fit anymore – it doesn’t mean that I won’t let them back into my life or that I am actively ignoring them but I found myself caring or maybe it’s more like thinking about them while I am pursing the thing that I never allowed myself to do while we were friends, when I am putting myself out there in a way that is not tied to their approval, or maybe it’s me doing my own thing without their support that makes me wonder what they would think about what I was/am doing – weird – because the fact that we’re not speaking is an indicator that they and myself have outgrown whatever version of ourselves and the way of life that we agreed to.</p>
<p>Stop Complaining – Talk about our joys – what you appreciates, appreciates. Offer thanks for the troubles that we don’t have. 4 Gs – Growth, Grit, Gratitude, Give – Jim has a thing for alliteration. it’s very cool.</p>
<p>Stop Overthinking – Just Start, it’s about progress, consistent effort everyday that leads to incremental improvements, a little by little, don’t over complicate – Small Simple Steps – ignore the noise, do you, work hard, keep learning, be kind and amazing things will happen. – thinking about practicing guitar daily now and blogging – i need to keep yoga and meditation in there as well.</p>
<p>Stop Self Criticism and Self Judgement – personal judgement – observe yourself – replace that with curiosity that will lead to greater growth. – the little voice in my head – something Mandy Morries also says about creating boundaries with your inner critic – I find myself doing that frequently throughout the day now when it tries to tell me something negative about myself or confuses me about my worth or makes me forget who I am and what I have been brought here to do – it’s very sneaky – and It locks itself into corners of the body too – it is sinister and cowardly – because it would rather eat away at you than come out into the light and love – this spiritual journey has been so interesting to learn about who and what I really care about – there is some blockages that I feel towards some people which means that I have a lot more work to do – like when I realize that I feel nothing when I think about them – that is an indicator that there is healing to do around that relationship – I would beat myself up and make myself feel bad for not feeling immediate love for that person as soon as I thought about them – now I recognize that it means more duration and space needs to happen before I can approach that relationship again – which allows for me to consider the events that led me to feel or not feel that way about them – which brings me to forgiveness – of self and other – I forgive myself for not loving completely – I kindly forgive myself for being human-ish and recognizing the calcification that has surrounded my heart – probably out of self protection and habit – but also mentally knowing that it won’t last forever and the journey towards real love and compassion is just as much part of the journey as it is for me to learn how to bend the D string and improve my pinky strength –
Stop saying you’re busy – it might become your identity – the goal is not to be busy, the goal is to find out what is most important to you in life – the goal is not to be burnt out – many people become burnt out because they are doing too little of the things that make them come alive – the things that light you up from the inside – this is tricky – when I heard Jim say that I felt a guttural fall in my belly – what do I love? it might be writing – it might be cooking – it might be making videos – it might be making music – it might be dancing – it most def is Micah – playing with her – it might be traveling – but I don’t think I’ve found that thing yet – I don’t know – I might be over complicating things for myself – I used to love being on stage with <a href="https://vimeo.com/311280851">The Who the fuck is Cho Chang show</a> – when I didn’t have a script and had to improvise the whole show with strangers on stage – I loved that – I loved doing magic on stage and learning about who I am in those moments – loved throwing oranges at the audience, loved inviting people up on stage to make waffles – loved the flow of events – the expectation and anticipation felt – it was a combination of directing, acting, playwriting, music making, food cooking, dancing, video making and music sharing – while growing community and solving problems in real time. I miss being on stage. I miss the theatre. Many of us do, I’m sure. There is a subway cart advertisement that says, “New York City: FIND WHAT YOU LOVE” In 2019 I remember feeling such comfort whenever I saw that sign on the side of the subway cart. It meant that I was doing the right thing because it meant that I was still looking and searching for that thing.

More than a quarter of the world’s population – about 2.1 billion people – lack access to clean water, according to a <a href="http://who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/jmp-2017/en/">report</a> released this week by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Accessibility of drinking water, availability when needed and levels of contamination were used to assess water services. National data were available for about 100 countries in 2015, and these are the 10 with the most poorly managed water supplies.</p>
