In the culture of Hannah Yukon – no one gets left out of the sharing circle. However, tonight feels like there might be a slight distinction between what needs to get said and what actually gets said.
Grind culture, anti-blackness, and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKUbXrslZC2/?igshid=11mixkmmsk28k">politics of naps</a> – a few breaths of joy, remembrance, tears and magic, Nina Foster is a wave of freshness, a hover over a Moon lit lake, and a deep dive into the unknown. Thematically, my brain is mush, which is to say that you will probably get more out of this conversation by listening or watching it.
To install plugins on wordpress, one has to upgrade to a business plan, which I am not ready to do just yet, seeing as how I am just learning how to use WordPress. I have a bad habit of paying for things and then not using them – some comfort thing having to do with security as ownership but letting it go to waste. Maybe I feel inclined in organize so much to not feel so bad about getting my first masters degree in community development and planning which was 2 years of understanding the internal fuckery that is the government.
Anyway – here are the YouTube links to the conversation between Nina and myself, split up into three parts because it was almost 3 hours long and my computer can’t handle that rendering project.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAPQxxgBwgM&amp;t=12s">Part One</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCTHZo-Jdw&amp;t=15s">Part Two</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxzmxIj4My8">Part Three</a>
<a href="https://love-go-do-it.captivate.fm/">or on this platform that I haven’t fully figured out yet</a>
In Plastic News, we had our weekly call with Susan Champeny last week.
<a href="https://youtu.be/6D2Rw5KZVuc">Plastic Play Wednesday #8</a>: Make an “All Seeing Eye” from plastic bottles, metal cans and sharpies.
And in case you missed the filmic essay I made to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krxuka10BuM&amp;t=4s">CEO and Founder of Starbucks</a> – two different people – as you will see, should you decide, to like, you know, actually watch this video. (I type this as I have my dad in my mind as someone who I might be saying this to?)
on clubhouse tonight in a room with women artists, I learned the extent to which some parents really fucked their kids up – some of whom are still struggling in their adult years.
“you won’t make it as an artist”
“why learn how to use the camera, you’re not a photographer”
“don’t be an artist, there’s no future in that.”
“I shouldn’t have listened to my father” – was someone one of the women said – I am reminded of the summer residency program at <a href="https://www.otis.edu/">Otis College Art and Design</a> that I got into but listened to my dad and how “I should save my money” instead of attending the three month residency program where I would have been able to build out the set for <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tony-radoszewski-eliminate-plastic-production-slaughterhouses-poverty-homelessness-and-the-war-forever">“Who The Fuck is Cho Chang?”</a> – I ended up going to ULTRA Music Festival – which was where tittiesforchange was born – another story for another day – I am an hour behind my bed time. going to bed on time is a challenge.
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/tony-radoszewski-eliminate-plastic-production-slaughterhouses-poverty-homelessness-and-the-war-forever">the petition that I spent almost 13 hours writing hasn’t hit 100 signatures yet</a>, maybe you might consider reading it and signing?
Last Thursday, during the <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-january">Full Wolf Moon</a> in <a href="https://www.starslikeyou.com.au/your-astrology-profile/moon-in-leo/">Leo</a> we had our first Titties for Change even for 2021. We were supposed to share stories from 2020 but we ended up in a circle burning pieces that held the things that we wanted to let go of and dipped another piece of paper into a bowl of water that held the things that we wanted to attract.
My Star of David fell off before the gym. Something about not honoring something – The Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services have been trying to get a hold of me to work for them but I am not responding to their emails.
Jim Kwik – <a href="https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-064-work-smart-not-hard/">Work Smart Not Hard</a> – Learn Earn and Return.
He tells us to ask ourselves, “What are the activities that have the greatest impact or return in my life? In your health, relationship, business, income, level of joy and fulfillment.”
This is an exercise I might choose to return to at a later point.
It is Black History Month – again – like it’s Christmas, or Easter – the weird thing about not questioning habit is how quickly things get normalized.
Still searching for the 100×60 structure of the word “FREEDOM” made in yellow concrete surrounded by pumpkin heads and armor guards in Minecraft – the last thing I made before I was fired for showing a video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ItsPBTFO0">Black Wall Street to the kids</a>. My toes are curled over each other, a comforting gesture to keep myself from losing track of reality.
The narrative of being a starving artist or even feeling the need to be one to validate one’s existence as an artist is a lie. It is something that needs to be debunked because if Burlington coat factory, Macy’s, Sears, TJ MAXX and Pier One (ikea too) stopped factor art, and Etsy became a physical location, art – in all of its forms would trade places with luxury watches (not that this is not art, I just have a personal vindictive attitude towards the notion that there is a market for expensive items to keep people and animals enslaved to a fabricated arbitrary system that is Time; that we’ve managed to convince the existence of a trade where spending $20,000 to watch a stick move across a plate of glass can make people feel validated and worthy of Being Here. That could build an entire house and provide food for thousands of people in other parts of the world. More art, less “time.”
Which reminds me, I am due for a breakup letter soon.
